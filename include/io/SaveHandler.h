    /**
    * @brief Append statistics for a single simulation tick to a file and forward to UI.
    *
    * This function takes a StatsTick snapshot (typically the one just created
    * at the end of the current tick) and appends one line to a CSV
    * statistics file located inside the ../stats/ folder.
    *
    * The effective file path is resolved as follows:
    *  - The base folder ../stats/ is created if it does not exist.
    *  - If dest_path is NULL or empty, the default file ../stats/stats.csv is used.
    *  - If dest_path contains "..", a safe fallback ../stats/stats.csv is used.
    *  - Otherwise, dest_path is treated as a file name under ../stats/.
    *
    * The amount of detail depends on the OutputMode in the Settings referenced
    * by p_sim:
    *  - NONE:    no file output generated (the function returns immediately).
    *  - NORMAL:  only a minimal set of core statistics per tick is written.
    *  - VERBOSE: an extended set of Tick statistics is written.
    *
    * In addition, the given StatsTick is forwarded to the UI so it can be printed.
    *
    * @param p_sim       Pointer to the Simulation containing Settings and Parkhaus.
    * @param p_tickstats Pointer to the StatsTick snapshot to write.
    * @param dest_path   Optional file name under ../stats/ (may be NULL or empty).
    *
    * @return OK (0) on success, ERROR (-1) on error.
